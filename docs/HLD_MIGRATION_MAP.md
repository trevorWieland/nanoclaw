# HLD Migration Map

This file maps retired HLD content into canonical docs so information remains traceable.

## Status

- Source material: retired HLD draft content (not tracked as a file in this fork)
- Migration target: canonical docs listed below
- Retirement intent: preserve section-level mapping here while destination docs stay current

## Maintenance Rule

When retiring another major document, add an equivalent mapping table before deletion.
